I’m so glad that I have found UX, the beautiful cross-section between tech and design. Since my childhood days on Geocities, I’ve been designing and coding websites for the world to see and I’m eager to bring my tech experience and design skills to the table in my new career. I am proud to be creating solutions in my field and intend to do so for many years to come.
