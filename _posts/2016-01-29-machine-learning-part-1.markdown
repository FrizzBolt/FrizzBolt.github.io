If you're like me in that you also aren't entirely familiar with high level complex math and data science concepts, then you might feel like machine learning is an area of study that's locked out of your range of understanding. That's an intimidating mountain to climb for a field of study that you don't even know if you'll enjoy.

Luckily for you and I, that's not the case. If you have a decent grasp on Python and can take what some people call a "top-down" approach to machine learning. How, you may ask? Well, admittedly, throwing together a neural network from scratch is going to be hard for near-beginners with a limited mathematical skill-set. BUT, there is an easier way, and I know that's cringeworthy to say, but there is. The solution itself, at first glance, may sound cringeworthy as well, but hear me out.

You can use a framework designed to do the mathy bits for you.

Ok. Before you grab a pitchfork and chase me out of town, consider this analogy: You don't have to know assembly to program. You may use a language that was programmed in assembly and still get similar results. With that in mind, it may be a good idea to tinker with a top-down approach to see if it's a rabbit hole you think it's worth jumping down.

In tackling this approach, you will run into many points where you will need to make decisions on how to run functions you don't understand. This seems like a majorly limiting factor in your work, but one thing that is important to understand about machine learning is that the usage of different functions becomes intuitive over time. The algorithms are typically so complex, that they involve tinkering and often-times the difference between using a Continuous-Log Sigmoid Function and a Softmax function will only be obvious to people who've used both functions in a wealth of different scenarios.

Now, if you want to prepare data for use in a machine learning algorithm, that's a slightly more precise art. A huge part of machine learning is formatting data so that it can be fed through the algorithm and translated back. I will not cover this in this series as there are plenty of data sets to use at the start of this adventure.

##Recommended Reading
* [Machine Learning Mastery](http://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/) (This is an excellent site for learning the top-down approach and was one of the inspirations for this guide.)
* [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) (If you already know some high level math, this is probably a good place to start. This is an excellent free book.)

##Courses
* [Coursera - Stanford Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (If you want to go all out and study the math and the theory, then this will likely be your ticket.)
* [Udemy - Machine Learning Course](https://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-machine-learning-in-python/) (This course is mostly theory and code examples with little math.)
