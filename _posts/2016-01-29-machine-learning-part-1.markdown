If you're like me, when you think of machine learning you think of computers solving problems using complex algorithms and large datasets. That's essentially true. If you're like me in that you also aren't entirely familiar with high level complex math and data science concepts, then you might feel like machine learning is an area of study that's locked out of your range of understanding. That's an intimidating mountain to climb for a field of study that you don't even know if you'll enjoy.

Luckily for you and I, that's not the case. If you have a decent grasp on Python and can take what some people call a "top-down" approach to machine learning. How, you may ask? Well, admittedly, throwing together a neural network from scratch is going to be hard for near-beginners with a limited mathematical skill-set. BUT, there is an easier way, and I know that's cringeworthy to say, but there is. The solution itself, at first glance, may sound cringeworthy as well, but hear me out.

You can use a framework designed to do the mathy bits for you.

Ok. Before you grab a pitchfork and chase me out of town, consider why you might be able to program without learning assembly. You may use a language programmed in assembly and still get similar results. Granted, if you want to work in research and development and design the algorithms yourself, you're going to need to know the math. But it may be a good idea to tinker with a top-down approach to see if it's a rabbit hole you think it's worth jumping down.

There's still one more concern that we have to tackle. You may have already looked at some code examples and asked yourself something along the lines of, "What the heck does 'gamma' mean?" This is a fair concern as there are some terminologies and concepts that are not easy to understand without a high-level breakdown of how to use them. That is one of the things I aim to cover in this guide as I am still looking for more and more succinct and intuitive ways to explain the concepts that drive machine learning algorithms.


##Recommended Reading
* [Machine Learning Mastery](http://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/) (This is an excellent site for learning the top-down approach and was one of the inspirations for this guide.)
* [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) (If you already know some high level math, this is probably a good place to start. This is an excellent free book.)

##Courses
* [Coursera - Stanford Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (If you want to go all out and study the math and the theory, then this will likely be your ticket.)
* [Udemy - Machine Learning Course](https://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-machine-learning-in-python/) (This course is mostly theory and code examples with little math.)
