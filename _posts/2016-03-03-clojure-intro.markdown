I want to jump back a bit into my past as a naive novice working on a mobile app in React-Native. At the time, I had no idea what I was getting myself into diving into a declarative front-end without really understanding the underlying concepts. This lead to some pretty ridiculous back and forth between the team as we scrambled to find a way to use a 'for' loop in our render window. Two months later, I took a casual interest in pure-functional programing languages and, after reading only a brief summary of functional concepts, I buried my face in my hands. Suddenly, the concept of immutable data made perfect sense and that little bit of understanding started a chain reaction of "eureka" moments that made ReactJS much easier to step into.

Declarative frameworks can seem counter-intuitive at first glance and wrapping one's head around some of the concepts surrounding them can be difficult without prior knowledge of basic functional programming concepts. Regardless, they can be faster and easier to maintain than other front-ends and, for that, they have secured a place in the future of front-end end development. With this in mind, learning functional programming concepts is extremely useful even if most developers will never develop in a pure functional language.

Enter Clojure - a well-designed, well-documented pure functional language that's an excellent candidate for functional dabblers and die-hards alike. The Clojure community is tightly knit and stocked with great minds solving simple problems.

My adventure through Clojure will not be over after I decide to turn my focus to something else. Practical use of the language is difficult and I'm very much about working through difficult problems. I'm having a lot of fun with this language and I intend to continue that.

Looking to take the plunge into pure-functional coding? Here are some resources to get you started:
