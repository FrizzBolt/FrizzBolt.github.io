# Boulevard Bikes

## The Challenge

Create an e-commerce platform for a local Chicago business. I chose Boulevard Bikes which is a local bike shop with a minimally functioning e-commerce platform.

---
## Design Practices Utilized

**Research:**
* Competitive Analysis
* User Interviews

**Synthesis:**
* Problem and Solution Statements
* Information Architecture Analysis
* Affinity Mapping
* User Personas

**Execution:**
* Usability Testing
* Iterative Design
* Sketching
* Wireframing
* High-Fidelity Prototyping

## My Role

This project was a solo endeavor. I was singly responsible for all research, synthesis, testing, and execution.

## The Solution

The e-commerce platform for Boulevard Bikes needed to be built from the ground up. At this point, there are design conventions for most online bike stores, but there were innovations to be made that expanded upon these ideas and added new features that would help bridge the gap between an in-store and online bike buying experience. Among these were a live chat feature, a bike comparison feature, and a feature which allowed the user to view any flaws or damages on used bikes.

## Project Takeaways

* Choose your user interview questions carefully. Donâ€™t guide participants into what you perceive might be a solution.
* Perform a contextual inquiry to better understand how users flow through the current site.

---

## Next Steps

* Flesh out compare feature further.
* Create a bike testing scheduler
* Create a feature to schedule bike testing.
* Implement a sizing and geometry guide into the bike details page.
* Make the chat window easier to find.
