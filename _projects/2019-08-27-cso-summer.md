# CSO Summer

---

## The Challenge

The Chicago Symphony Orchestra recognizes that the majority of people who attend performances are from older generations. While these performances are currently well attended, CSO is concerned about ensuring that it continues to maintain relevancy in the community in years to come. In a group of three over the course of two weeks, create an solution to help draw Millennial audiences to CSO events.

## My Role

This was a group project with three members. For this site, I was partnered with two fellow UX designers. I was involved in nearly every step of the process, save for the heuristic evaluation and the journey map.

## Competitive Analysis

We first ran a direct competitive analysis against the apps and websites of several competing theaters and event venues as well as an analysis against other places and services that may indirectly compete with the CSO for the user's time. This yielded some interesting results. Firstly, several competing venues have their own apps available, many of which contain ticketing systems and informative content about the show. Next, we found that social media presence was a feature of every venue. This appeared as though it may have been a necessisity for remaining relevant among Millennial audiences. Thirdly, the CSO has a good deal of competition when it comes to vying for Millennial's time. Social media and streaming services offer some things that are not available to live audiences.

## Screener Survey

After a teammate performed a heuristic analysis, we sent out a screener survey as a means of gathering basic data about our users and finding a means to contact them for user interviews.

## User Interviews

After contacting the users for an initial round of interviews, we were left with some key takeaways:
* Going to an event with other people is a key reason that people will attend the Symphony.
* Cost is a key factor when considering going to an event.
* People prefer live music over recordings because they enjoy the experience of attending a live event.
* Millennials associate the CSO with a racially homogenous older audience, which drives them away from attending.
* Some, often less musically experienced attendees find Symphony events boring.
* Millennials most often choose to listen to music via streaming services such as Spotify and YouTube.

## Contextual Inquiry

Lastly, for this section of our user research, we performed a contextual inquiry of the existing CSO site. Our test users were unable to locate a specific event called Sound Post that was geared towards Millennials using the current CSO website. One user said that she would need to reach out via the online concierge service if she wanted to buy a ticket to the event, but she wouldn't have known it existed if we had not instructed her to find it.

From all of this data, we came up with our problem and solution statements.

---

## Problem Statement

As a Millennial, I need the experience of symphony events in the summer to be fun, relevant, and affordable, because I want to be able to convince my friends to come with me, and to have a memorable experience together. 

---

## Solution Statement

We created an app to engage Millennials, many of whom are in “constant fear of missing out” by providing ways to share relevant content and event info through social media to get friends excited about attending the CSO together. The app is focused on CSO summer events so that they can be engaged on their phones before, as well as during these events.

---

## Affinity Map

With these statements in mind, we then synthesized our research into an affinity map to better understand our user's relationship with music and entertainment.

## User Personas

From the collected research and synthesis, we generated our primary persona, Katie Burns, who is a Millennial music enthusiast who goes to the CSO a few times per year. Our secondary persona, Tom, has never been to the CSO and is not really interested in going unless someone invites him.

## User Flow

It was time to put our prior research and synthesis into a user flow for our new app. The user flow was subject to several changes over the course of our app design cycle. This is our final iteration of it.

## Journey Mapping

My colleague, Margaret Aiken, then created a journey map for our pending application. It details our primary user's emotional flow as she goes through the process of buying a ticket and attending a CSO event.

## Wireframe

From our sketches, we created digital wireframes which were designed to be built into a digital prototype.

## Evolution of our homepage

This image illustrates the evolution of our homepage through four versions ranging from sketch to wireframe. Areas that changed over iterations are circled.

## Medium-Fidelity Prototype

This video showcases a completed, medium-fidelity iteration of a digital prototype.

## Project Takeaways

* When working in smaller groups in an educational setting, working together on every aspect of a project can be a good learning experience for some. As the project scales up, however, taking a more Agile approach toward structuring the workflow of the project can be more beneficial.
* Paper prototyping is an important part in the iteration process. It may be tempting to move straight into digital wireframes from sketches, but it's much faster and more efficient to prototype in low fidelity first.

## How We Could Improve Our Project

While the execution and research of this process are thorough, I believe that the solution itself could be made more innovative. I would like to see a solution that addresses the pain points of both of our users without containing much of the functionality of other more popular applications. As helpful as I feel a ticketing application would be, I see the games side as a more creative solution to the problem at hand and would like to use that as a springboard to developing the app in a different direction.
