I am a seasoned hobbyist and aspiring coder with a background in music, comedy, and animation - as well as some less exciting admin work. I grew up in the northern Suburbs of Chicago to a family that owned a computer resale business and between selling memory at computer shows and making cheesy pre-CSS webpages with my friends that had no real content, I began to assimilate my computer education. I worked as a freelance graphic designer through high-school and quickly found that I had a knack for working in Adobe Illustrator which lead to my wanting to pursue a career in animation. I ended up attending Columbia College of Chicago pursuing a degree in Computer Animation.

After running into financial and family difficulties I was forced to put school on hold and had a choice to pursue either music or graphic design while working an office job to pay my dues. I ended up taking a break from the visual arts and hunkering down on my music education. Since I had grown up playing classical piano, I wanted to break free from the confinement of pre-written music and learn to improvise. This lead me down a long road of teaching myself several other instruments. Eventually, I grew weary of the administrative lifestyle and didn't see a career for Å“myself in that field so I decided to get back into code. My friends eventually convinced me to join up with Dev Bootcamp and I'm glad that they did! I feel like I've rediscovered my childhood techie self and am developing on the old BASIC skills I learned in grade-school.
