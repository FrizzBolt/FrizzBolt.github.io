<h3>How arrays work</h3>

<p>I like to think of an array as a shelf full of items. The items can be strings, integers, floats, or even more arrays (shelves). An array can be defined like so:</p>

<div class="code">array = ["i'm", "just", "dying", "in", "your", "arms", "2" "-nite."]</div>

<p>Arrays can be manipulated through various predefined methods as well as iteration techniques. Say I wanted to bunch up my array into one line of glorious 80's nostalgia. I could define a method to do that:</p>

<div class="code">def nostalgia(array)<br>
	array.join " "<br>
	puts array + " Must have been something you said."</div>

<p>But that's just one method. The list of built in string manipulation methods extends for miles and the mastery of methods is something that takes great time and research. For that reason, I won't go terribly in depth.</p>

<p>If I wanted to call up just one piece of my array, I would do that by grabbing the index. The index system looks something like this:</p>

<div class="code">
array = ["Jen", "Ted", "Pat", "Roy"]<br>
index #&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3
</div>

<p>The first item in the array has the hash of 0 and it goes up from there. Say I wanted to call Pat's string, I would type:</p>

<div class="code">
array[2]
</div>

<p>...and that would return "Pat". I could also call the last item in a string by typing:</p>

<div class="code">
array[-1]
</div>

<p>...and that would return "Roy".</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>How hashes work</h3>

<p>Hashes are like bigger and more organized cousin of the array. A hash consists of a list of key/value pairs which</p>

<p>Say I have a list of silly names and the phone numbers which are paired to each name. The hash could be defined like so:</p>

<div class="code">
phone_directory = {<br>
&nbsp&nbsp"Bob Bobbins" => 9152940564<br>
&nbsp&nbsp"Glob Globbins" => 9159859240<br>
&nbsp&nbsp"Sheral Muxlix" => 8492958483<br>
&nbsp&nbsp"Hob Squazin" => 4149285483<br>
}
</div>

<p>In this example, the names are the 'keys' which are paired with the phone numbers which are the 'values'. You can call a value from the previous hash using this value.</p>

<div class="code">
hash_name["key_name"]<br>
</div>

<p>This would return the matching value of the key. So...</p>

<div class="code">
phonedirectory["Bob Bobbins"]
</div>

<p>Would return Bob's phone number, 9152940564.</p>

<p>There are also ways to iterate across keys and values of hashes. I could organize the names alphabetically with the following method:</p>

<div class="code">
Hash[phone_directory.sort]
</div>

<p>Just as with arrays, hashes too have hundreds of different predefined methods for iterating and organizing so once again, I won't delve too in depth.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the main elements in ruby. Between strings and arrays and hashes, you should have your hands full for quite some time. I know mine are full right now.</p>
