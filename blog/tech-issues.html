<h3>Bright Young n00bs</h3>

<p>First of all, let me introduce this post by saying that I'm not very fond of it. I intend to go more in depth into this next week and that will require rewriting this. That said, here's my post about issues in tech:</p>

<p>There's no denying that this is an age of exponential growth of computational power. Moore's law is still holding strong despite nearing its theoretical limit. The average twenty-something is decked with hardware and the average American home is becoming more and more becoming rigged with hackable tech. </p>

<p>Automation is on the rise as well. Businesses are gradually transforming into turn-key operations and administrative jobs are set to decrease as machine-learning algorithms iterate through massive databases, performing in mere seconds operations that would have once taken an entire team of typists months. Even the works of great artists are slowly being usurped by fiendishly clever artificial intelligences and procedurally generated content.</p>

<p>The ecomnomic upside to all of this, of course, is that with ever passing second, information becomes more and more available to us. The exchange of ideas is opening up and that's affecting the state of education. What once would have taken a trip to the library and hours of a flipping drab textbook and catalogue system can now be accomplished in seconds from one's phone.</p>

<p>It should come as no surprise that many millenials are jumping ship from their non-tech gigs and joining many of the free online education programs to steer their careers onto the path to tech. In a capitalist economy, the technophobes will almost always lose out and the wisest of these bright young minds will thrive under the tech umbrella. In the generation following the millenials, only the tech-savvy will survive. Augmented consciousness, once a sci-fi crackpot theory will become the norm and suddenly regular consciousness will be less impressive. It's probably important to get these youngsters off of the soccer fields and onto the internet.</p>
