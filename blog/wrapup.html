<h3>Turning the Page</h3>

<p>So here it is. One of the most tangible fruits of my labor over the past few months. My blog. I have to say, it's not ugly, but I still have a long way to go with it. I'm not sure the whole paper-on-wooden-table design is conducive to the coding environment.</p>

<p>Over the course of building this website, I feel like the biggest appreciation I've gained is for the existence of backend development. Every time I've had to update a link, I've had to backtrack through each and every blog post and sub-page and it's had me wishing I'd had the time to go back and add a more consistent framwork to my site before. To put this in perspective, if I'd continued blogging at the rate I've been blogging for the past two months, by next year I would have an additional 35 blog posts to slog through every time I wanted to adjust add a link to my navbar.</p>

<p>This week at Dev Bootcamp, we had the option to add a framework to our site. The instructors had warned us that adding a framework would be a messy and difficult process. I so wanted to take a large chunk of my week to add a framwork to my site, but I'd been limited by my last week of work and training three employees to take mine and my former colleagues places.</p>

<p>I did do a lot of reading into the merits of different frameworks and it's left me curious as to how I will hash this out once I have time to create a more professional looking blog. I am curious about Jekyl as it seems to make the design process as painless and minimal as possible. I feel like this is great news for back-end developers as they are mostly judged on the quality of their code. In my case, since I am interested in full-stack development, I don't think this would be the ideal candidate for a framework.</p>

<p>I am tempted to use Semantic-UI because the company I worked for up until yesterday uses it and the product has a nice clean feel. Part of me thinks, though that pure JS is the way to go. Sure it sounds masochistic, but it would ultimately provide me with the right amount of practice for front-end design that I would need and I'm sure it would be an impressive portfolio piece as well.</p>

<p>We'll see. Like I said, I have a long way to go, but this little site was fun to make while I had the time.</p>
